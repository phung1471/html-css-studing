# You can define custom names globally, or on a per gateway basis, if you define your gateway here, it will take priority
# and then will fall back to any of the global renames defined below (if set). The example below shows how you would rename
# the default fields for the Stripe payment gateway, and how to rename field names globally

SilverStripe\Omnipay\GatewayFieldsFactory:
  rename:
    prefix: '' # e.g "card_"
    #name: 'myName'
    #type: 'myType'
    #number: 'myNumber'
    Stripe:
      name: 'name' # e.g change to newName
      #number: 'myStripeNumber'
