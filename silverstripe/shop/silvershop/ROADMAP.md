# Roadmap

These are our planned milestones.
Also see our [planning Trello board](https://trello.com/b/85ZyINqI/silvershop-development-planning).


## 1.3: Expected release: April 2016

* mostly bug fixes and minor improvements

## 2.0: Expected release: Summer 2016

* Translation improvements
* Omnipay 2.0
* Address review

_Upgrading from `1.x` to `2.0` should not be a big deal for most sites. Breaking changes will be in the areas of Omnipay 2.0 compatibility and translation keys._

## 3.0: Expected release: When SilverStripe 4 is stable
